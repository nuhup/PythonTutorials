#Exercise 1 (2 points)
#Evaluate Sum and Average for this collection of incoming numbers 
#HINT: remember that the funciton len(c) provides the length of the collection 'c'
#NOTE: print them in console

inc_num = [100, 20, 20, 30, 30, 50, 50]


#Exercise 2 (2 points)
#The following data-structure represent a police officers in the Mitte department. 
#Inside the officer dictionary there is a list representing the value of each fine
#that the police officer made today (in euro).
#Evaluate the Sum and the Average for those tickets
#NOTE: print in console Name, Surname, ID, Sum and ticket (individual lines is fine)

police_officer = {
  "tickets_values": [100, 20, 20, 30, 30, 50, 50],
  "name": "Magnum",
  "surname": "P.I.",
  "id": 70859
}


#Exercise 3 (1 points - to get 1)
#Apply the solution in Ex num 2, for a list of police officers, like the following one.

police_officers = [
  {
    "tickets_values": [100, 20, 20, 30, 30, 50, 50],
    "name": "Vincent",

  },
   {
    "tickets_values": [30, 20],
    "name": "Mia",
